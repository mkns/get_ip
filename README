These two scripts and associated text file just allow me to find my
home machine when I need to SSH to it from work.  Since my ISP gives
me a dynamic IP address, clearly it could be anything.  And while it
doesn't tend to change very often at all, I also don't take any notice
of what it is, ever, so on the odd occasion I need to log in to my
home machine from work, I can just go to my web page and find out the
IP address.
